🛠️ **How to Compile and Run**
All code is compiled and run from the root directory of this repository using a standard C/C++ compiler (GCC or Clang).

1. C++ Files (.cpp)
To compile and run any C++ file:

Bash

# Example: Folder/SubFolder/[file_name].cpp
g++ DSA/Array/[file_name].cpp -o [file_name]_prog

# Run the program
./[file_name]_prog
2. C Files (.c)
To compile and run any C file:

Bash

# Example: Folder/SubFolder/[file_name].c
gcc DSA/Array/[file_name].c -o [file_name]_prog

# Run the program
